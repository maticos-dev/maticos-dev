# 👋 Hi, I'm Mateo  

I'm a freshman in ECE with a passion for machine learning, large language models, and open-source projects.  
Here’s a quick look at what I’ve been working on:

---

## 🌟 Featured Project: TensorAtelier  
[**TensorAtelier**](https://github.com/maticos-dev/tensor-atelier) is my project focused on experimenting with machine learning pipelines and tools.  
It highlights my work with large language models and transcriptomics — including experience with META’s ESM model via Hugging Face.
